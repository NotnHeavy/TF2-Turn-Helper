# (TF2) Turn Helper
This plugin shows whether you are turning enough to gradually increase your speed with the shields.

| Colour  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Red  | Not charging, you are +20 degrees further than the maximum angle, you are -20 degrees less than the minimum angle, or you are not gradually increasing in speed.  |
| Yellow | +/-10 degrees from maximum angle  |
| Cyan  | +/-5 degrees from maximum angle  |
| Green | Sufficient.  |

The code isn't great, because I don't really understand game maths to an adequate extent (yet).

Made for SolarLight.
